My customizations and modifications for the project https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4178426.


Main changes:
* adding inserts to avoid screwing the screws into the plastic
* strengthening of key element
* adding a built-in bumper mount on the chassis
* adding space for tube bearings wherever the plastic movable element comes into contact with the thread / bolt
* new mounts for larger shock absorbers
* mounting to metal differentials and suspension shafts.
* removal of unnecessary plastic from some elements
* rounding of sharp corners
* and a few smaller ones.
